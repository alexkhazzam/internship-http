Please read the assignment below carefully. Keep track of the time spent on this task.

SETUP

Set up your local system from android dev
Download the following:

https://developer.android.com/studio
STEP ONE

Build an Android app that has a Search Page. The search page will have a Search Input, Search Button, Search Results List. When the search button is selected, send an HTTP GET request (https://developer.android.com/training/volley/simple#java) to https://api.github.com/search/repositories using the user-entered search text.
For example, if the user enters "react-native" in the search input and presses SEARCH, the following URL would be sent over GET

https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=react-native&sort=stars&order=des
So you have to build the URL using the user-entered String

String urlString = "https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=" + searchText + "&sort=stars&order=des"
The results from GitHub look like this:

{
  "total_count": 100,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 29028775,
      "name": "react-native",
      "full_name": "facebook/react-native",
      "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react-native",
      "description": "A framework for building native apps with React.",
      "created_at": "2015-01-09T18:10:16Z",
      "updated_at": "2020-07-02T20:49:29Z",
      "svn_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react-native",
      "homepage": "https://reactnative.dev",
      "stargazers_count": 88387,
      "watchers_count": 88387,
      "language": "JavaScript",
      "open_issues_count": 984,
      "watchers": 88387,
    }
]}
You can parse this JSON string using the built-in JSON parsers (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/android/android_json_parser.htm) Your list page will show the "full_name" field for each item in the "items" array.

If no results are found from the search, display "No matches found" text

STEP TWO

When a user clicks a row from the search results, route the user to a detail view that shows the following values for the selected row
Full Name (full_name)
Description (description)
Language (language)
GitHub URL (html_url)
Hompage URL (homepage)
Created (created_at)
Updated (updated_at)
Stars (stargazers_count)
Watchers (watchers_count)
Open Issues (open_issues_count)
